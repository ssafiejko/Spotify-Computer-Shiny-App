    In contrast to Tymek, she is a true fan of Dawid Podsiadło and was listening to his music during the whole month of December.</h4>",
    
    "Wojtek" = "<h4>Wojtek enjoys many different kinds of music - he is not afraid of mixing genres, even the toughest ones. Having listened Miss You - Sped up version on repeat throguhout the entire period of preparing his first Numerical Methods project, it appears as if he was Oliver Tree's psychofan. <br>
    Other than that, Jose Feliciano appearing on the list shows just how much he enjoys Puerto Rican rhythms, especially if they are incorporeted in christmas songs. Do not misinterpret his interest in Hard Techno - he is the calmest person out there! <br/>
    What may be shocking to some, Wojtek does not really look at the clock too often and listens to music basically at any period given of the day.

    "Tymek" = "<h4>
                                        Tymek, during the analyzed period, listened mainly to energetic Polish music - mostly the finest artists of polish rap or alternative pop. <br/>

                                        Before and after Dawid Podsiadło's concert, which took place on the 6th of December, he played much more of his music than in any other period. Shortly before Christmas break, he got hooked on more jazzy music, but this trend isn't that noticeable in the plots.
                                        <br/>
                                         After polish artist Kuban released his new single from the upcoming album, Tymek rediscovered his music, which is visible after the 8th of December.

  Natalia also mainly uses the computer to study and gain knowledge, but she also finds time to play League of Legends. <br/> She prefers working during the day rather than at night and her most active days were the 26th of December and the 7th of January.

  "Wojtek" = "<h4>On the example of Wojtek it clearly shows just how much computer usage differs if the person mainly uses a desktop computer. Wojtek, being the night owl he is, primarly uses his PC to communicate with others, study a bit and play some games.<br/>
  All of that, obviously, once he comes back from the wonderful building of his faculty. It is also clearly visible when the actual work over this project began, making RStudio reach the top 5 in almost any period starting from December 17th.
  </h4>",
  "Tymek" = "<h4>Tymek uses his computer mainly for his studies. It isn't challenging to notice when and on which project he was working at the given time - the majority of the most used apps are applications he uses for studying, probably he has almost no free time. 

He spent the first part of Christmas away from the computer, but the day with the most significant number of switched windows was the 26th of December - when he started doing projects for his studies. <br/>
He mostly used his computer in the evenings. However, on some days, it is visible that Tymek also used the computer during the day - for instance, writing notes at the faculty.

                                        </h4>"

MERGED_DESCRIPTIONS <- list(
  "Natalia" = "<h4>Definitely, there is a connection between Natalia's activity on Spotify and the computer. <br/> She doesn't have a favourite music pace for studying, and a higher level of energy of listened music does not affect the frequency of changing windows- while listening to slow music, she changes them even more often than while listening to fast music. </h4>",
  "Wojtek" = "<h4>Wojtek despises using his computer in the early morning hours, yet his listening to music capabilities seem unlimited. Becuase of the kind of person he is, fast-paced music is his companion no matter what he does on his computer <br/>
  Another interesting observation about Wojtek is the sheer amount of different artists he listens to, sometimes exceeding 100 different musicians over a period of a week. Wojtek also seeems to be accustomed with high-energy music, making him not care about the high bpm in his eardrums while changing window tabs, as he often does it faster while listening to some groove. </h4>",
  "Tymek" = "<h4>
It is visible that the time Tymek used his computer somewhat overlaps with listening to music. <br/>
Even though it seems quite counterintuitive, while studying, he listened mostly to more energetic and fast music, as it sometimes helps him stay focused and diversifies writing hundreds of lines of code. </br>

The hypothesis that we change window apps more frequently while listening to faster music was not confirmed in the case of Tymek. Although it is noticeable that he is changing windows more often than Natalia, less frequently than Wojtek
